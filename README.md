Car rental application â€“ one feature problem statement

A vehicle can be rented for a trip. Vehicle can be a SUV, car, van, bus, etc.

The standard rate for a petrol vehicle for a standard trip is 15 Rs/Km. Additional 2 Rs/Km charge is applicable for AC vehicles. Diesel vehicles cost a rupee less than standard rate.

Big vehicles like SUV, van, bus, etc. always run on diesel. SUV is always AC.

2% discount is applicable for bus on standard rate.

Additional charges of 1 Rs/Km/Person are charged if number of passengers exceeds the max limit of a vehicle.

The route of the trip always starts from Pune.

All the distances to all destinations are specified in KM from Pune.

Sample distance:

Pune: 0KM

Mumbai: 200KM

Bangalore: 1000KM

Delhi: 2050KM

Chennai: 1234.5KM

In this big car rental application you are tasked to develop an API which calculates the total expense for a given trip. Do not use any property file to store the values mentioned above. Instead think in terms of injectable interfaces to provide the information assuming members of your team will be responsible to develop the same. You develop a default implementation for the same where data is hard coded. Actual implementation of those may pull data from database, file or http service.

Example trip: Swift, Diesel, NON AC, Pune-Mumbai-Pun
